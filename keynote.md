New interesting features:

- Connect Payouts

- Radar + Radar for Fraud Teams
- Global payments and treasury network 

## David Singleton, Head of Product and Engineering

- Billing, Connect, Payments, Sigma, Radar
- Want to help accelerate the movement of money
- Web 2.0, but we have 1.0 purchase experiences

- They launched Stripe elements last year.
- New Stripe checkout, considering Europe's new SCA regulatory requirements
- New Stripe Terminal, provide more unified global coverage for in store payments, demo with Stripe Press
- Stripe Issuing: programmatically control how money is spent. Granular control with programmatic spending limits.
  - Technology, Regulatory, Contractual, Ecosystem (opaque system among banks, processors)
  - Does this mean Stripe is a bank now? Since it can programmatically issue cards.
  - Is it a VISA card? What is the card network? How does this affect my credit score?
  - Stripe example: https://rocketrides.io/
  - https://github.com/stripe/stripe-connect-rocketrides
  - gogocards?
  - not traditional credit cards: fully programmable, including authorization controls
  - programmatically issue and distribute money in the physical world
  - Swing by office hours to demo the issuing cards
- Extending the Stripe platform to the physical world is a major initiative for Stripe this year
- They have a global payments and treasury network: I'm very interested in the infrastructure of this.

## Claire Hughes Johnson, COO

- built Google's adwords network
- online commerce still lives in a world with brittle integrations, especially when it comes to physical purchases
- it's time for commerce to be as agile as marketing (think a/b testing ad campaigns and progammatically optimizing ad campaigns)
- IT / Risk + Finance / Support
  - number of people who need access to Stripe grows
  - granular roles and permissions in the Stripe dashboard
  - support for SAML and single sign on
  - Stripe Radar has blocked 4 Billion in fraud
  - There's a 90% chance Stripe has seen the credit card before
  - Early Stripe was well known for the quality of its support
- Dan Chadre, Mindbody
  - A fitness apps company that realized it should be a payments company
  - 19 areas in the application that take payment, expanding ot Singapore
  - Ability to have a single point of integration has just never existed
  - "omnichannel commerce experience"
  - Make payments the experience, not something we have to do as a side effect

## Patrick Closing Words

- Billing, Connect, Terminal, Payments, Issuing, Sigma, Radar -> all backed by Stripe's Global Payments and Treasury Network
- There are novel kinds of billing coming about: payments is part of the product experience.
- Scaling products globally is what Stripe is committed to. "Infrastructure for Globalization"
