### Panel Notes

- Focus on historically underserved users: immigrants and SMBs (small and midsized businesses)
- Stripe solves the accounts receivable side very well (how much money do I have?)
  - In order for SMBs to pay their providers (who do I owe?) they have to bring in another provider outside of Stripe
- Shopify offers "Shopify Capital" as a way to inject funds to small businesses.
- How does an immigrant build credit? How do we solve this problem?
  - Cash isn't good enough in order to thrive in the new country.
- only 30% of payments for businesses are done electronically on Xero
  - Checks are still predominant
- Payments is now a major revenue stream for Shopify
  - Expanding their financing and billing platform
- Creating a seamless experience

How much of the payments stack do you bring in house?

- Standard Connect
  - Xero uses this. Their aspiration is to build the best accounting platform.
  - Xero would rather focus their energy on building a better end product and partner with Stripe on the risk management/settlement.
- Custom Connect (whitelabel)
  - Shopify uses this, (4k employees)
  - build vs buy vs partner vs acquire vs fork
  - Shopify is a commerce company, not a payments company

How do you figure out which markets to prioritize?

- Remitly founder spent time in Kenya and it allowed him to better understand the problem
- Some markets make sense to launch together (ones with similar local compliance requirements)
  - Launching Canada and US are two completely different compliance markets
- Next big bet is Asia Pacific
- Shopify payments are available in 10 countries
- Real creativity comes when constraints are applied.
  - Strike the balance between feature development and infrastructure.

Closing thoughts

- Payouts are hard due to the fragility of the destination
- Would be great in the future to have a closed loop: have payouts and payin ride the same rails
- More collaboration with the government
- We're still stuck with ACH after all these years in US.
